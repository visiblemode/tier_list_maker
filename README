Hi Momo.

1. index.htm can be loaded right now to render new tier-lists immediately, 
   following the format you posted for the level 30 tier lists.
2. If you want to save these as actual images, use `https://html2canvas.hertzen.com/`
   (this is what TierMaker uses to create images out of the tier list maker)
3. If you want to update the format of the data going in, take a look at `js/parse-data.js`.
   Basically, update that function to massage your data into the
   expected data format (`tiers` argument in `js/create-tier-list.js`)

Lemme know if you've questions or want help modifying any of this!
This is the basic tier list, but if you wanted to do stuff like add in the "total score" below each mon,
Or like their ingredient icons, etc, this code should be extensible enough to do just that. 
Lmk if you'd prefer for me to make those changes for you.
